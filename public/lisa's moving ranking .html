    <h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>

<hr/> 

<h3>Howls Moving Castle</h3>
<p>I think this is possibly Miyazaki's most intriguing movie. All of his other films are very linear and even though their highly varied worlds may be visually stunning and highly creative, I feel the dreamy world of Howls Moving Castle is by far the most captivating, bizarre, and imaginative of all the worlds Miyazaki has ever envisioned.

    What I love about this movie is that it's highly emotional without a great deal of logic or plot or story to get in the way. In this way the film is simple, pure, and extremely beautiful. It is as if the characters go from one emotion to the next, in a world that is as random as one's own dreams. Some people have complained about the lack of plot or story or serious character development, but even though the characters are fairly static, their emotions and the physical changes they undergo as they go through these emotions brings out a higher truth that is seldom given such artistic and natural freedom.
    
    I think this is a very smart movie in many subtle ways and it's one that I look forward to watching again on the big screen and then on DVD.</p>
<h3>Good Will Hunting</h3>
<p>This is one of my favorite movies of all-time. I showed it to my kids (14 and 12) and both really liked it and responded to it. The language is off-the-charts bad, but it fits in with the characters and there are so many good messages in this movie that it is more than worth it. I would say this is Robin Williams' best movie and the scenes with him and Matt Damon are so powerful. A tremendous movie that holds up incredibly well...</p>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>It is spectacular, and brutal, and enigmatic and disturbing. When you wake up from a good dream, you feel the reality is harsh. When you wake up after a bad dream, you will be sentimentally attached to the beauty of reality. But as long as life is good, reality and dreams don't matter.</p>
